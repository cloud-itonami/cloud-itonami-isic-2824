  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the mining/quarrying/construction-
  machinery plant analog of `cloud-itonami-isic-6512`'s `casualty.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- unit intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds design-rules verification +
                                 stability/braking-test defect
                                 screening writes, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:unit/intake` (no capital risk
                                 yet) may auto-commit. `:actuation/
                                 dispatch-unit`/`:actuation/issue-
                                 stability-certificate` NEVER auto-
                                 commit, at any phase.

  `:actuation/dispatch-unit`/`:actuation/issue-stability-
  certificate` are deliberately ABSENT from every phase's `:auto` set,
  including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a rollout
  milestone still to come. Dispatching a real robot unit action on a
  safety-critical earth-moving machine and issuing a real ISO 3450/
  10262 stability-and-braking acceptance certificate are the two
  real-world legal acts this actor performs; both are always a human
  heavy-equipment manufacturing engineer's call. `heavyequip.governor`'s
  `:actuation/dispatch-unit`/`:actuation/issue-stability-
  certificate` high-stakes gate enforces the same invariant independently
  -- two layers, not one, agree on this. `:stability-brake-test/screen`
  is likewise never auto-eligible, at any phase -- the same posture
  every sibling's screening op has. Phase 3's `:auto` set here has only
  ONE member (`:unit/intake`) -- this domain has no separate no-
  capital-risk 'file' lifecycle distinct from the unit record itself.")
